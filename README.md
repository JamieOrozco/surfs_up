## Summary: 
* As you can see from the results the mean temp between June and December only had a difference of 3 degrees. 
* The maximum temp between these to months only had a difference of 2 degrees. 
* The mean of precipitation has a difference of .09 in the winter months. 
* Based on this information the temperature should not be major factor in the success of the shop. The difference in rainfall could potentially affect the business during December. I would recommend they run an analysis of the population and the proximity of other similar business.
